Data Understanding and Exploration:

Load the dataset and understand its structure.
Explore the data to understand the distribution of positive and negative reviews.

Data Preprocessing:

Remove Noise: Remove unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stop words.
Lowercase Conversion: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Tokenization: Split sentences into individual words or tokens.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form to standardize different forms of a word.

Feature Extraction:

Bag of Words (BoW): Convert text into a matrix of token counts.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Convert text to a matrix of TF-IDF features.
Word Embeddings: Use pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe to convert text into numerical vectors.

Model Selection and Training:

Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training and 20% testing).
Choose Algorithms: Consider different classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.
Train Models: Train the chosen models using the training data.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using the testing data.
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

Model Optimization:

Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Consider using techniques like cross-validation for a more robust evaluation.

Model Deployment (Optional):

Once satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it for real-world use.
Consider creating a user interface or API for others to use the sentiment analysis model.
